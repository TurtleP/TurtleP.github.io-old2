My name is Jeremy Postelnek. Ever since I was younger, I was fascinated with video games. In high school I took computer science courses so that I could learn write my own. In college I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science.

Over the years I've created several games. The first being Turtle: Puzzles, a puzzle-platformer. Unfortunately it wasn't that great, but I kept on trying to make games. In the process I created Turtle: Invaders with several other users from the [Stabyourself](https://stabyourself.net/forums) forums.

So far I've made several small games and at the moment I'm in the middle of creating Turtle Tale (a remake of Turtle: Puzzles) with an actual plot and better mechanics. I am also writing a fiction novel. Both of these are listed under the projects dropdown.
