# 2.0.0

### Release Date: 2021-01-16

#### Changes from 1.1.0

**General**:
- Absolutely destroyed the old codebase and reimplemented everything
  - Followed (most, if not all) of the LÖVE codebase line-by-line per object
    - Implemented what could be done and had to be done from 1.1.0
  - The [LICENSE.md](hhttps://github.com/TurtleP/LovePotion/blob/master/LICENSE.md) has a proper disclaimer about this
- Use proper matrices instead of "fake" matrices ([#69](https://github.com/TurtleP/LovePotion/issues/69) *nice*)
- Improve ogg vorbis audio support
- Improve wave audio support with wuff, a special library just for LÖVE
- Implemented the [data](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.data) module and its components
- Implemented [Transform](https://love2d.org/wiki/Transform) objects
- Implemented [Text](https://love2d.org/wiki/Text) objects
  - On 3DS, addf does not support multiple wrap modes and limits
- Implemented debugging functionality via `nxlink` on Switch & 3DS gdb
  - Prior to use, you will need to enable the `console` flag in `conf.lua`!
    - See [this part of the Wiki for details](compatability?id=debugging-your-game)
- Implemented [`love.graphcis.intersectScissor`](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.graphics.intersectScissor)
- Added [luasocket](http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/luasocket/)
- Implemented the [thread](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.thread) module and its components
- Implemented the [sound](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.sound) module and its components
- Reimplemented the [event](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.event) module
- Reimplemented the [filesystem](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.filesystem) module and its components
  - Due to physfs becoming available, it greatly increased the compatability here as LÖVE uses it too
- Added the [love.focus](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.focus) callback
- Added the [love.resize](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.resize) callback
- Added system functions:
  - `love.system.getRegion`
  - `love.system.getModel`
  - `love.system.getVersion`
    - Returns the current Firmware Version
- Switched to using an embedded nogame.lua instead of using RomFS
- The error handler got an update -- you can now save the error to the SD Card by pressing `a`.
  - This will write to `save/{identity}/errors` at the timestamp the error occurred.

**Switch**:
- Remove SDL2 in favor of deko3d
- Implemented the `font` module.
  - Fonts can now be loaded (only TrueType for now) through this module.
- The `screen` parameter in `love.draw` has been updated
  - The parameter now gives `"default"` instead of `nil`

**3DS**:
- Removed `love.graphics.setDepth(number depth)`
  - It has been replaced with `love.graphics.getStereoscopicDepth()`
    - This returns the 3D slider's value -- how you use it for 3D depth is up to you
    - See [this Wiki example](compatability?id=miscellaneous)
- The `screen` parameter in `love.draw` has been updated
  - The parameter now gives `"left"`, `"right"` and `"bottom"`
- Clean up clearing/rendering logic to be more akin to deko3d on Switch
- Added proper [`love.graphics.printf`](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.graphics.printf) support
- Added `love.graphics.setBlendFactor(number factor)` to allow tinting textures.
  - If zero is passed, LÖVE Potion will only change the alpha component instead
  - If non-zero is passed, it will tint textures with that much of a strength, best to use 1.
  
## Known Issues

**Switch**:
  - The "debugger" seems to be having issues. This will be resolved at some point soon.

**3DS**:
  - `love.filesystem.mount` doesn't seem to be working for zip files sometimes. May be due to the file size, but unsure.
