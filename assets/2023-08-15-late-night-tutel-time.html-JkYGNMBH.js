It&#39;s been another eight months since I&#39;ve posted anything, but here I am! Let&#39;s start things off with the obvious: a fresh coat of paint.</p><h2 id="new-blog-theme" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#new-blog-theme" aria-hidden="true">#</a> New Blog Theme</h2><p>One of the things I wanted to do recently was overhaul the blog design. The old one was good, don&#39;t get me wrong, but realistically it had some issues. Mainly that GitHub Pages uses jekyll by default - which uses the ruby programming language. That itself isn&#39;t bad, but installing ruby on Windows is like pulling teeth. I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s as hard as it was when I tried to do exactly that a couple of weeks ago. I debated on what static website generator to go with and decided to use vue-wordpress with this &quot;hope&quot; theme. It looks super slick. Took me a bit to set up almost everything I wanted to be as expected, but I got there at least.</p><p>One thing you might want to check out is my VRChat Memories gallery. It <em>was</em> hidden away before, but I decided to make it more accessible now.</p><h2 id="life" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#life" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Life</h2><p>This is probably the longer segment out of all the entire post. Lots happened. I recall blogging about how I lost my job back in late October, but the good news is that it only took two months to get a new one. I was extremely nervous, but confident going into the interviews for my current job and had made it to the code exam (dear <strong><em>god</em></strong> do I hate those)! This time around I prepared myself ahead of time as all I knew was I had to use C# and Selenium to create and run automation tests. I would be given a specific website and then I was on my own. I&#39;m super glad that I passed that and became their top candidate because I am doing really well at my new company, compared to the prior one.</p><p>Furthermore, I got a new pet. Her name is Nala and she&#39;s a pit bull mix. I originally had a pet turtle for about a year, although if I&#39;m being honest, it wasn&#39;t the right pet for me. My friend at the time had convinced me that getting the turtle would be good and low maintenance to a degree. However, after a while I had issues trying to take care of her because of some unknown reason. I mean, I did <em>try</em> to take care of the turtle, but she refused in a way. I wound up taking her back to PetSmart for adoption. Regardless, I adopted Nala from someone who listed her on the local animal shelter&#39;s website and she&#39;s been great. She is super sweet, loving and drives me crazy almost every day, but I love her and wouldn&#39;t trade her for the world.</p><p>Lastly, some news.. well everything here is news, but whatever. If you noticed, I at some point changed my blog title to my online alias (and the avatar too, but ¯\\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯). Now, I&#39;ve changed the blog name completely, sort of. Now assuming my parents never find my blog.. which they haven&#39;t yet (since I have spoken about the stuff that&#39;s happened between us on here): I&#39;m trans. I originally figured this out about two years ago if memory serves. I spent a lot of time in VRChat - and I mean (<em>checks Steam</em>) 2,946 hours total in there. During that time I&#39;ve only ever felt comfortable wearing female avatars. All the masculine ones just didn&#39;t even sit right with me. Mostly because their designs, but also because they didn&#39;t resonate well with how I felt. Over time, I wound up being mute around newer people depending on how I felt, (this was around 2020, a year after I started playing). People had mistaken me for a girl, which is understandable because I&#39;m not speaking and also in a feminine avatar. After some time I came to my decision that I actually did enjoy people referring to me with she/her pronouns and it took a bit longer to settle into the idea of changing my name as well.</p><p>Initially I met some friends in a Vtuber&#39;s community (who are awesome people by the way) and they helped me ease into being more comfortable. After that, I changed my Twitch username to reflect my new name. I did tell some other friends online about all this, but that&#39;s not entirely important. At this point, only my one coworker knows, one cousin knows, my closest friends know, and my siblings and their spouses (and my sister-in-law&#39;s sister) know as well.</p><p>That all said, I have no idea if I&#39;ll ever tell my parents. My mother might be accepting, but my father - that&#39;s unlikely unless Hell froze over.</p>',11),s=[i];function r(h,l){return t(),a("div",null,s)}const u=e(n,[["render",r],["__file","2023-08-15-late-night-tutel-time.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
