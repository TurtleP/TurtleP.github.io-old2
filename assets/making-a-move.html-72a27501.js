Even if it&#39;s 8pm EST. I never really mentioned it, but I moved back home with my parents in New Jersey. It&#39;s been about a month since I came back and I honestly regret it.</p><p>I&#39;d have hoped that many things would have changed once I moved back in, but for the better. They did at first which I was very surprised by. Unfortunately it didn&#39;t last too long and there was a miscommunication and/or misunderstanding with dinner plans. My sister had my father and I talk it out and we came to a mutual understanding, one that would work for at most two weeks.</p><h2 id="what-happened" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-happened" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What Happened?</h2><p>During this time, I did follow through with things as necessary. Not like I was being forced, but I knew in the back of my mind that I just had to deal with it. I did my chores when they asked, which is genuinely all I asked of my parents to do for me. I&#39;m not the best at keeping time, due to my ADHD, but it seemed to bug my father quite a bit that I didn&#39;t do things &quot;on time&quot;. I expressed the issue with my ADHD interfering with doing stuff, as I&#39;ve been off meds for almost seven years &quot;under control&quot; of it, but there&#39;s still a lack of understanding from him and my mother in regards to it.</p><p>The following weeks up until now have been kind of.. <em>depressing</em>, really. I&#39;ve really never thought that it could be a possible issue until recently. I&#39;ve been a bit frustrated with regards to work, but only slightly. Nothing major. The rest of it comes from the remaining weeks since about early-mid September. I don&#39;t want to dawdle and keep myself from telling everything, so here it goes: those weeks have just been brutal verbal abuse that I can&#39;t stand any longer.</p><p>It isn&#39;t exactly anything horrible, trust me. The worst thing that impacted me was him making snide comments, especially about &quot;going back to my old ways&quot; in which I wouldn&#39;t do things on time and just reside in my room all the time. I <strong>don&#39;t disagree</strong> that it occurred, so <em>why</em> am I so upset about it? It goes back to the original issue at hand: trying to keep myself sane while doing as I&#39;ve been asked. I also happened to be getting involved with some of my hobbies again which rely use of my desktop in my bedroom.</p><p>I spoke to my siblings and they reassured me that they stand behind my decision to move out. Last Friday I went to a Starbucks and applied to an apartment. It&#39;s not too far from work just 5 minutes away in fact. A lot of good things can be said about where it is, but it doesn&#39;t matter in this context. I drove back home almost regretting the fact that I actually applied to it. Inside I was greeted by my father who was unusually calm about my late night (7pm EST versus 5:30/6:00pm EST) arrival. I turned on my desktop and couldn&#39;t connect to the internet at home. I figured it was odd. My suspicions were clear that he&#39;d blocked (at least my phone and desktop) from accessing the WiFi (and I even texted him about it, and he admitted to it). I presume this was because he found out that I spoke to one of my friends briefly before he &quot;banned&quot; me from talking to them (over an apology said individual &quot;owed&quot; my mother. That&#39;s another story, but the whole thing was dumb because they were going to voluntarily apologize in the first place--and forceful apologies weren&#39;t an option for my friend in the sense of being entitled to one &quot;because&quot;). This issue only solidified my reasoning for the application.</p><h2 id="bittersweet-closing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#bittersweet-closing" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Bittersweet Closing</h2><p>I plan to tell my parents I&#39;ve moved out once I settle in tomorrow. I don&#39;t think they&#39;d somehow find this blog post (or my site anyways), but hey, if they did, I want them to know I love them, but deep down it hurts to write any of this. I&#39;m sick of how I&#39;ve been treated the past month and need not only time away from them, but my independence again. I need my mental health to be repaired from enduring the yelling and comments. I wish they understood what it feels like to be me, sitting in my room typing this out--having been frustrated with being treated poorly the past few weeks--although I tried that on Saturday, but neither of them were willing to listen or be understanding and it just sucks.</p><p>Anyways, on a cheerier note.. I was approved yesterday morning and I signed the lease today. I&#39;m planning to move in tomorrow before my flight on Thursday for my brother&#39;s bachelor party.</p>',11),s=[i];function r(h,d){return t(),o("div",null,s)}const u=e(n,[["render",r],["__file","making-a-move.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
