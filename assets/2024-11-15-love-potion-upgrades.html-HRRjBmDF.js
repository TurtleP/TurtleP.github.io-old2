It&#39;s been a minute since I posted anything noteworthy to my blog, but here we go. Let&#39;s talk about something I&#39;ve been cooking for a little over half a year now: the newest iteration of LÖVE Potion, 3.1.0. While it&#39;s still not fully done, I did want to express the excitement of the new changes and mountain of fixes to the codebase that should make <em>you</em> excited as well. Seriously.</p><h2 id="a-clean-slate" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#a-clean-slate" aria-hidden="true">#</a> A Clean Slate</h2><p>Now, the first thing to mention is probably some context. Internally, all of LÖVE Potion&#39;s code has been overhauled <em>again</em>. Yes, again. The same reason that 3.0 exists as it currently does because <em>that</em> was its own rewrite. One could argue this should be considered 4.0, not 3.1.0, but the internal changes are really just stability™ and a few enhancements, nothing major.</p>',4),c={href:"https://github.com/lovebrew/lovepotion/issues/226",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},u=t("code",null,"Source",-1),m=t("em",null,"templating",-1),f=t("em",null,"so much code duplication",-1),p={href:"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/crtp",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},g=t("p",null,[e("Fast forward to today, almost everything from 3.0 is reimplemented and the codebase is "),t("em",null,"much"),e(" cleaner than before.

This is now much more optional, as it will automatically fetch the screen information of what is currently being rendered and return it as appropriate. You can still request it manually (or it&#39;s planned at the very least if I haven&#39;t added it yet) for when you want a specific screen.</p><h4 id="the-love-draw-callback" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-love-draw-callback" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The <code>love.draw</code> Callback</h4><p>Not too much of a noteworthy thing, but now <code>love.draw</code> will pass the current 3D slider value on Nintendo 3DS as a secondary parameter. This makes it a <em>lot</em> easier to draw stereoscopic 3D items on the screen.</p><h4 id="better-batched-rendering" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#better-batched-rendering" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Better Batched Rendering</h4><p>LÖVE Potion 3.0 already had batched draw calls, but honestly it was awful. While it <em>sort of</em> batched draw calls (as in, more or less did), it used purely vertices and that took up a lot of memory, which especially on 3DS, we do not have a lot of. When I started working on the graphics API, I stared at the beast that LÖVE utilized for batched draw calls. I was terrified since it made no sense at all, but over time as I learned about how to use citro3d on 3DS I was able to figure it out. LÖVE uses a combination of a vertex buffer and index buffer which leads to reduced memory usage overall when drawing.</p><p>This gives the 3DS a massive performance boost when rendering (and a boost for the other consoles, but unsure how significant). How massive are we talking? Rendering a ton of text no longer lags the whole damn console. You can also render like 200 &quot;points&quot; (which are just circles and their radii calculated by point size) and still have 60FPS. I even did a test with <em>500</em> points and that dropped it to 40fps which is still insane <em>and that was technically 1,000 because it rendered to both screens</em>.</p><h4 id="pure-citro3d-backend" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pure-citro3d-backend" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pure citro3d Backend</h4><p>A massive undertaking, to some degree. LÖVE Potion 3.0 for Nintendo 3DS currently uses <em>citro2d</em> which focuses only on the two-dimensional aspect of drawing. If I was going to make 3.1.0 worth the rewrite I absolutely had to use citro3d instead to give myself more flexibility and control. citro2d can only render certain primitives and fonts, but we had to match what LÖVE could do. Learning the API wasn&#39;t terrible, but I certainly did struggle getting the <code>StreamBuffer</code> class set up.</p><h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Conclusion</h2><p>LÖVE Potion 3.1.0 is shaping up to be a massive leap forward in performance, usability, and features.
