Löve Potion is based on the *awesome* 2D game framework, [LÖVE](https://love2d.org)! Originally created by [Videah](https://github.com/Videah) for 3DS in its early homebrew days, I had helped it grow in its functionality. 

Eventually I took over with proper permission and reworked it from the ground up. This meant tearing apart every function, variable--and outdated library--so that it would function on the newer 3DS homebrew utilities, like citro2d. 

Now Löve Potion is ported onto the Nintendo Switch and shaping into a more solid version that mirrors its non-console counterpart. 
Creating 2D homebrew games has never been easier on an amazing console! To get started on your own 3DS or Switch game, please refer to the GitHub repository Wiki [here](https://github.com/TurtleP/LovePotion/wiki)
