LÖVE Potion is based on the *awesome* 2D game framework, [LÖVE](https://love2d.org)! Originally created by [Videah](https://github.com/Videah) for 3DS in its early homebrew days, I had helped it grow in its functionality.

Eventually I took over with proper permission and reworked it from the ground up. This meant tearing apart every function, variable--and outdated library--so that it would function on the newer 3DS homebrew utilities, like citro2d.

As of right now, LÖVE Potion has grown into something amazing. It has fourteen out of seventeen modules implemented and a majority of LÖVE objects as well. There's very few things that are different between the console and regular application counterpart. Feature requests and bug reports are always welcome!
