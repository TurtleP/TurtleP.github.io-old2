Löve Potion is based on the *awesome* 2D game framework, [LÖVE](https://love2d.org)! Originally created by [Videah](https://github.com/Videah) for 3DS in its early homebrew days, I had helped it grow in its functionality.

Eventually I took over with proper permission and reworked it from the ground up. This meant tearing apart every function, variable--and outdated library--so that it would function on the newer 3DS homebrew utilities, like citro2d.

Now Löve Potion is ported onto the Nintendo Switch and shaping into a more solid version that mirrors its non-console counterpart.
Creating 2D homebrew games has never been easier on an amazing console! To get started on your own 3DS or Switch game, please [refer to the Wiki](https://TurtleP.github.io/LovePotion/wiki)
