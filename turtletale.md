A game about a lone turtle, minding his own business inside his home. One day, while asleep, he is awoken by an earthquake and investigates. Unfortunately for him it's a phoenix! The phoenix is out for lunch and prepares to cook the turtle with flames. The turtle ducks for protection, and in doing so lives, but his home is burnt down. He passes out and the phoenix leaves him alone--for now. When he wakes up in a furious outrage he swears to have his revenge on the phoenix.

Jump, punch, and solve your way through a mountain full of dangerous enemies that lurk inside. Make your way to the top and defeat the phoenix to exact your revenge!
