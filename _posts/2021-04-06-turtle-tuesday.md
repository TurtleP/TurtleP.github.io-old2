## The Agenda

So I figured that instead of doing this last Tuesday, why not start fresh next month? After all, it'll give me some extra time between the posts to collect my thoughts. Aside from that, I figure that the first Tuesday of a month will be a post like this where I share information about something *specific* that I'm passionate about and then some kind of summary at the very last day of the month.

Today I'm going to talk about the novel revamp and how that's going.

## Novel Rewrite

I'm not sure how many people even check my blog, or even the amount of people who do care about the fact I'm writing a novel. In either case, though, the point is that I've decided that it was best I start the whole thing over, save for some details. The reason that this was done is because the current story is.. okay at best I suppose? It was fine until I lost motivation again and then when I did pick it up, tried to modify the already existing data in the chapters. This really bothered me a lot because I'd look into what I could change to sound better or less "cheesy". Sometimes these things worked, but not all the time. It's fun that the novel didn't take itself seriously all the time and that's what I *absolutely* loved with it. However, too much of it can be a problem, like the following scenario: during Chapter 1, Serena and Esmund are going to the forest and Serena is pushing branches out the way and one of them snaps back, almost hitting Esmund behind her. She shouts how she's sorry for letting that happen and Esmund comments to himself how forgetful or clumsy she is.
