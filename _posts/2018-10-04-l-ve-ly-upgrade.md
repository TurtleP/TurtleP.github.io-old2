## Hardware Acceleration
Finally after a long wait, GPU rendering support has come to Switch homebrew! If you've ever thought about making games on Switch, now is the best time. GPU rendering allows for better performance with OpenGL (or in the current situation for Löve Potion, SDL2 hardware acceleration).

## Call for Contributions
There will also be a seperate branch which can be contributed to for OpenGL on the repository [here](https://github.com/TurtleP/LovePotion/tree/gpu). Any help with getting the graphics ported from the original LÖVE framework to here will be greatly appreciated!

## Games
Mentioned before, I look forward to people writing more games for homebrew on Switch with Löve Potion. If you make a project, please let me know and link its GitHub or itch.io to me on the repository or Discord.
