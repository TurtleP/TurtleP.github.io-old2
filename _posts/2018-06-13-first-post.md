After looking over at the old website design, I decided that it was time for a more professional look. The old site wasn't horrible, but it wasn't exactly the best (especially functionally). Furthermore, I kind of wanted to get back into blogging if possible. I enjoy writing, hence the fact I've got a novel in the works. It should definitely motivate me to start working on it again.

I never intended to stop working on it in the first place, of course. It's just most of my time is being taken up by my job or just doing other personal projects. I'll be taking a small-ish break from Love Potion, and this way I can hopefully work on my novel once more. The creativity of writing is just so enjoyable, and I don't wish to abandon it--not yet at least.
