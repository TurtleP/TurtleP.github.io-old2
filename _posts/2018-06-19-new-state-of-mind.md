I figured I'd post about this since it's something that's rather important to me. I got a job back in November. They asked if I was alright with relocation, and I was. I still am. That's the point of this post: I'm now in a different state. I previously lived in New jersey, a place that's 300 miles from me now. I'm far away from my parents, and closer to one of my siblings.

It's kind of bittersweet, really. I don't want to go into deep details, but it's kind of a relief and a involves a long healing process. I'm not a social person by nature, but honestly, I didn't want to deal with certain things back home. I'd get quite a bit of smack from my father.

Now I'm in Maryland far away from any possible issue with him. It's kind of hard to say I do miss him when I really feel like I shouldn't I'm just very conflicted as of late, since I've been thinking about it However, I think that in the remaining time here in my new place, he'll come to learn from his mistakes.

I'll be heading back home this weekend to get some of my stuff !couldn't take for this initial week, and I'm genuinely hoping for signs that he's gotten better towards me. Unfortunately, it might take more time than that, as my siblings left for months on their own accord only to come back for more important holidays as per our relgious beliefs or national holidays. My father treated them better once it had been months, but hopefully it doesn't take that long in my case.

Anyways, I'm enjoying my time here in Maryland. It's only been four days, but it's a very beautiful state, and home doesn't compare to it I've no idea what might happen when the year ends.. if my job brings me back to New jersey or if I can stay here. That's a discussion for myself in the future of course.

The adjustment to life in Maryland will take some time, but I'm open to this change, even if I was stressed as heck on arrival.
