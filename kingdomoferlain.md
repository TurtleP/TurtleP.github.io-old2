One stormy night, a cloaked man ventures into the woods to fulfill his wishes: summoning a dragon. Using dark magic, the magnificent beast rises from its gravesite anew. His plan is coming together, and he laughs as nobody can stop him now.

A young boy, Esmund, wakes up from this dreadful nightmare. He falls out of bed, and his sister, Serena, rushes into his room concerned about him. He dismisses her worries, assuring her that he is fine. Once the duo go hunting together, Esmund wanders into a familiar area--the same one from his dream.
