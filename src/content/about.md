I’ve been passionate about video games for as long as I can remember. In high school, I took my first computer science courses to learn how to bring my own games to life. That passion grew into a career path—I went on to earn a B.S. in Computer Science, where I continued honing my skills in programming and game development.

Over the years, I’ve created several games, starting with *Turtle: Puzzles*, a puzzle-platformer. While it wasn’t perfect, it taught me a lot and motivated me to keep improving. Later, I collaborated with members of the Stabyourself forums to create *Turtle: Invaders*, a project that showed me the value of working with a team to bring ideas to life.

Beyond game development, I’m also exploring storytelling through writing. I’m currently working on a fantasy novel, crafting a world full of adventure and magic. Creativity comes in bursts, but it’s an exciting journey that keeps me learning and growing as a storyteller.

I’m also the lead developer of [LÖVE Potion](https://github.com/lovebrew/lovepotion), a port and reimplementation of the LÖVE game framework for the Nintendo 3DS, Switch and Wii U. Much of my free time is spent improving and refining the framework, contributing to the indie game development community.

When I’m not coding or writing, I love diving into new technology, especially virtual reality. My fascination with VR started during a 3D game design course at university, where I experienced the thrill of gliding through a virtual world. That moment gave me chills and deepened my appreciation for the possibilities of immersive tech.
